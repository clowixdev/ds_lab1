# Laboratory work for University

### Work with files and command line arguments

In this laboratory work we have to work with text files.
We created program that changes words from File2.txt in File1.txt on the
words from File3.txt and pasts the result into File4.txt

All the pathes to the files are read by programm as command line arguments


### ACCEPTED!
